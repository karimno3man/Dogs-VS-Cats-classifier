# Dogs-VS-Cats-classifier
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built entirely from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras, to classify images of dogs and cats. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kaggle "Dogs vs Cats" dataset, containing 25,000 labeled images (12,500 dogs and 12,500 cats).
